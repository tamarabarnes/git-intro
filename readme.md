## Terminal 
these are some terminal commands we covered today 
cd -> change directory 
moving back to the parent folder cd .. 
adding files within a folder -> touch folder.name 
moving from folder to sibling folder -> cd ../sibling-folder/ 
addding new folders -> mkdir 
- pwd 
- cd 
- mkdir 
- touch 
- rm
    - r flag is recursive to move sub folders 
    - f flag is forcing the removals 


##  Markdown 
- for quotes we use the following 
> this is someone elses quote 


- to input code in we do this below
```
code goes here
```

- this is to output a sentence or text in python - e.g. Hello world 
```py
print("Hello World!")
```

- this is for javascript to print words out - e.g. Hello world 

```js
console.log("Hello World!")
```

## git and github 
![Github icon cat](./images/githublogo.jpg)

- what is Git and Github?
    - it is a source control management tool (Version Control System)
    - edit your code, then save again. 
    - every time you save, it will create a new version (commit)
    - this is like taking a screenshot for every "save" you do 
    - this is useful when something isn't working you can go back to the latest save/version and see if something went wrong 
    - remote repository
    - track changes in the code (it can be anything, even if you wanted to write a poem or novel)
    - move forwaerds or backwards in your versions of code easily 

## github steps 
- create a remote repo
- link it with the ocal repo 
- push the latest commits
